# vscode-expo-starter
Starter project for Expo running in Docker with VSCode as the development environment

Run expo using the command:
`expo start --tunnel` or `npx expo start --tunnel` to get a QR code that can run from within the container. This will enable you to connect Expo Go to your app using the QR Code.
